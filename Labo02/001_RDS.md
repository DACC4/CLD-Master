```bash
[INPUT]
//check db engine version
mariadb --version

[OUTPUT]

## Task 02 - Deploy RDS

### [Create DB subnet group](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/rds/create-db-subnet-group.html)

|Key|Value for GUI Only|
|:--|:--|
|Name|DBSUBGRP-DEVOPSTEAM[XX]|
|Description|DBSUBGRP-DEVOPSTEAM[XX]|
|VPC|VPC-CLD|
|SubnetIds|Both private subnets|

### [Create RDS](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/rds/index.html)

* [Supported MariaDb Version on RDS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/MariaDB.Concepts.VersionMgmt.html)

|Key|Value for GUI Only|
|:--|:--|
|Data type|Standard create|
|Engine options|Check your Drupal Instance|
|Template|Dev/Test|
|DB Instance Identifier|DBI-DEVOPSTEAM[XX]|
|engine|depending on your Drupal config|
|master user name|admin|
|master user name password|DEVOPSTEAM[XX]!|
|Instance config|Burstable classe - db.t3.micro|

|Existing VPC Security Group|Your own security group for RDS purpose|
|Availability Zone|eu-west-3a|
|Monitoring|Disable Enhanced Monitoring|
|Backup|Disable Enable Automated Backups|
|Encryption|Disable Encryption|

### Security Check : Estimated Monthly Costs

for IAM role permission reasons, you do not have access to RDS cost information. Here is the information you need to make a comparative analysis.

|Key|Value for GUI Only|
|:--|:--|
|DB Instance|13.87 USD|
|Storage|2.66 USD|
|Total|16.53 USD|

Note : AWS ask for add-on. Close it.

## Task 03 - Test whether the database can be reached from the Drupal Instance

### Get the RDS Endpoint (you need to wait few minutes after launching)

```bash
[INPUT]
//Try to get the same kind of output
```

```bash
[OUTPUT]
[...]
|||                                          Endpoint                                          |||
||+------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------+||
|||  Address         |  dbi-devopsteam[XX].xxxxxxxxxx.eu-west-3.rds.amazonaws.com              |||
|||  HostedZoneId    |  XXXXXXXXXXXXX                                                          |||
|||  Port            |  3306                                                                   |||
[...]
```

### Test the access to RDS from your Drupal Instance

```sql
[INPUT]
//help : mysql -h <rds-endpoint> -u <rds_admin_user> -p

[OUTPUT]
```

### Questions:

* Compare the costs of your RDS instance to a continuously running EC2 
  instance of the same size using the [AWS calculator](https://calculator.aws/#/addService). (Don't forget to
  uncheck the **Free Usage Tier** checkbox at the top.)

```
//TODO
```

* In a two-tier architecture the web application and the database are
  kept separate and run on different hosts. Imagine that for the
  second tier instead of using RDS to store the data you would create
  a virtual machine in EC2 and install and run yourself a database on
  it. If you were the Head of IT of a medium-size business, how would
  you argue in favor of using a database as a service instead of
  running your own database on an EC2 instance? How would you argue
  against it?

```
//TODO
```

* Copy the endpoint of your RDS.
